# NYCHA Outages

NYCHA regularly updates a [web page](https://my.nycha.info/Outages/Outages.aspx) that displays information about service outages for heat/water, elextric, elevators, and gas that are planned, ongoing, or recently resolved. This project scrapes the data from all of these tables and saves the results in CSV files.
